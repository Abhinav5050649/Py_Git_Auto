## About the Script

1) This script was designed keeping in mind the bash terminal or the git bash terminal.
2) Works on PowerShell(Tested on PowerShell 7.2.2)
3) One may face difficulties while running the script on macOS as I have not designed this script keeping in mind the ZShell(I don't use Apple devices)
4) In order to use this script, one must have setup the ssh key on one's system with respect to one's GitHub Account!!!
5) While entering the path when prompted, try to write the full path if possible, for best results.
    Example: 'C:\Users\XYZ\ABC_Dir\' or '~\Desktop\ABC_dir\'
